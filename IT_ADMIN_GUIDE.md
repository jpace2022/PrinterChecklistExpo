## 💡 Best Practices for IT Admins

### Documentation
- Use the **Notes** field to document:
  - Installation date
  - User department/location
  - Special configuration requirements
  - Troubleshooting history
  - Ticket numbers

### Network Configuration
- **Always use Static IPs** for print servers
- Document MAC addresses for DHCP reservation fallback
- Keep gateway and DNS consistent across infrastructure
- Use descriptive CUPS queue names (e.g., `office-hp-color`)

### Security
- Complete all security checklist items
- Change default CUPS admin passwords
- Consider SSL/TLS for sensitive environments
- Document firewall rules in notes

### Testing
- Always complete the testing category
- Test from multiple client types (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Verify web services work end-to-end
- Document successful test prints

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- App stores data locally (no cloud sync)
- No passwords are stored in the app
- CUPS admin credentials should be managed separately
- Consider device encryption for sensitive environments
- Firewall rules are documented, not configured by app

---
